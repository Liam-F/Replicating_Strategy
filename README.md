Replicating Strategy
--------------------------


This exercise was done as part of the [Professional Master in Quantitative Finance ](http://eesp.fgv.br/ensino/mestrado-profissional/economia/area-financas-quantitativas) program that I have been doing. You can check my report <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ucaiado/Replicating_Strategy/blob/master/UiraCaiadoEx01.ipynb" target="_blank">here</a>. The text is in Portuguese. I will implement a dynamic strategy that uses self-financing hedging to replicate the payoff of a derivative that is described as a stochastic process. I will use mostly Python to code the project.
